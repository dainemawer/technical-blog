// 'unsafe-inline' on script-src, in production too: React/Next's own RSC
// hydration payload ships as inline `self.__next_f.push(...)` scripts on
// every page with a Client Component — that's not optional, and without
// 'unsafe-inline' (or a nonce) the browser blocks every one of them, so
// the page never hydrates at all (confirmed directly: a production build
// with zero analytics code still throws React error #412 under a strict
// script-src). The documented fix is nonce-based CSP via Proxy, but that
// requires dynamic rendering on every single page (no static generation,
// no ISR) — not a trade this mostly-static blog is making. Subresource
// Integrity was also checked: Next's own docs rule it out for this case
// ("cannot handle dynamically generated scripts"), which the RSC payload
// is. 'unsafe-inline' still leaves script-src doing real work: it blocks
// loading a script from any origin outside 'self' and the two allowed
// analytics domains — it just stops enforcing against inline content,
// which matters less on a site with no user-generated content rendered
// back to visitors. No nonce: that would force every page dynamic, so
// GTM's dataLayer bootstrap stays a same-origin static file
// (public/gtm-init.js) rather than adding to the inline-script surface —
// only gtm.js and GA4's collection endpoints need domain allowlisting,
// and only once NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID is actually set.
